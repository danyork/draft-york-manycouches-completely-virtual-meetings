.# Abstract

This document captures initial thoughts about having IETF meetings that
are completely virtual. It explores the issues involved with both a
"planned" virtual meeting and an "emergency" virtual meeting. The intent
is to evolve this document to provide answers to the questions posed
throughout the text. This is currently a thought experiment. There are
no current plans to hold a completely virtual IETF meeting.

#  Introduction

What would a "completely virtual" IETF meeting look like? What would be
issues? What would be the advantages? How could it work?

The "manycouches" design team was convened to explore these issues and
understand what might be involved in holding a completely virtual meeting.
On 20 July 2016, members met with the IESG for a joint discussion at the 
IETF 96 meeting in Berlin. This document outlines many of the key issues and questions for discussion that emerged out of that Berlin meeting as well as
mailing list conversations.

Discussions identified two types of potential meetings the IETF could have 
that would be completely virtual:

1. PLANNED VIRTUAL MEETING - A "regular" meeting of the IETF that would be planned to be completely virtual.
2. EMERGENCY VIRTUAL MEETING - There could be a situation where a planned physical meeting suddenly needs to be virtual due to physical or political situations. For example, a natural disaster shortly before a meeting might cause people to not be able to attend.

Tools and processes may be very similar between the two types of meetings.
A key difference is that for an "emergency" meeting there may be the desire 
to replicate the planned schedule of the physical meeting as closely as possible.

It is unclear if the IETF might ever choose to hold a planned virtual meeting, but this document is designed to facilitate the discussion around 
what that might look like. A desire is that some of this development may 
help with improving the current experience for remote attendees to today's
physical IETF meetings. It may also be the case that some kind of "hybrid"
meeting emerges with physical meetings taking place in multiple locations
with virtual participants joining in remotely.

It is also worth noting that in discussions to date the sense has been 
that even if we held a completely virtual meeting, it would only happen
once out of several meetings. There would still be multiple physical IETF 
meetings during the year.

## Why Do IETF Meetings Take Place?

[It may be good to insert some text here about WHY we have IETF meetings
and what the overall goals are. Both as a reminder of the point of the
meetings and potentially to frame thinking about how we might move toward
those goals by trying doing things a bit differently.]

## Why Hold a Completely Virtual IETF Meeting?

[At some point in the maturity of this document it would be valuable to 
discuss the benefits and challenges of a completely virtual meeting. 
Before that summary can be developed, though, further investigation and
development needs to happen. At a very high level, one idea is that a 
completely virtual meeting might make the meeting more accessible to 
more people in terms of schedules, lack of travel and reduced costs. 
However, all of that thinking need considerably more exploration. 
Several participants in discussions have voiced the opinion that 
replacing physical IETF meetings will be close to impossible. This
document is being developed to explore all of these issues.]

##  Conventions and Terminology

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**",
"**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [@!RFC2119].

Additionally, the key words "**MIGHT**", "**COULD**", "**MAY WISH TO**", "**WOULD
PROBABLY**", "**SHOULD CONSIDER**", and "**MUST (BUT WE KNOW YOU WON'T)**" in
this document are to interpreted as described in RFC 6919 [@!RFC6919].

# Program

## Meeting Structure

With a completely virtual meeting, the structure of the meeting does not 
have to comply with the traditional IETF meeting schedule. It could, for
instance, stretch out over the entire 24 hours of a day. Questions for 
discussion include:

- Is the meeting still structured over a week?
- Do the meetings still exist within certain hours?
- Do multiple meetings exist at the same time as they do now?

Again, in the case of an unplanned "emergency" virtual meeting the desire
may be to stick with the already-planned schedule. But for a planned 
virtual meeting the schedule can be open for discussion.

There was some discussion that a meeting could span more than the 
traditional week. However, the counterpoint is that keeping it within 
a week gives a focused block of time that people could allocate for 
participation in the virtual event.

## Timezones

What timezone does a virtual meeting operate in? Or does it operate in 
multiple timezones?

One suggestion was that each working group might choose its own timezone
based on the best timezone for the main contributors and leaders. (Although
this might then limit participation from other areas of the world.)

This timezone issue was identified by multiple participants as the hardest
aspect of planning a virtual meeting.

## Deadlines

What do deadlines look like for a completely virtual meeting? Are the
deadlines for agendas and drafts kept as they are for a regular meeting?

## Plenaries

What does a plenary look like in a virtual meeting? The same large session
as today?

## Breaks

There are breaks planned throughout the days of a physical IETF meeting
to enable people to move between sessions and to have refreshments and
restroom breaks. Similarly there are longer breaks for lunch.

How are breaks structured in a completely virtual meeting? 

- Can they be shorter?
- Do you need a longer "lunch break"? Or does that make no sense?

## Tutorials

On the Sunday starting an IETF week we commonly have a series of tutorials.
Are those still part of the program for a virtual meeting?

## Hackathon / Code Sprint

The Hackathon and Code Sprint have become popular activities before a 
physical meeting. Would they still exist for a virtual meeting?

## Other Physical Meeting Elements

In a typical IETF physical meeting, there are other meetings and activities
that occur alongside the meetings of Working Groups and BOFs. These include:

- Newcomers Meet and Greet
- Welcome Reception
- Bits-N-Bites
- Thursday Lunch Speaker Series
- Social Event

Do any of these additional sessions still make sense in a virtual meeting?

The Thursday Lunch Speaker Series (by the Host organization)  could continue
as webinar-style presentations. But the other elements involve face-to-face
interaction that would be difficult in a virtual setting. 

## Sessions by non-IETF groups

Other organizations sometimes hold meetings during the time
of the IETF physical meeting and often use the same venue. For example, 
the Internet Society usually offers an "ISOC@IETF Briefing Panel" during 
the Tuesday lunch break. At some IETF meetings groups have shown films 
or scheduled other meetings. These are not IETF meetings, but make 
use of the opportunity of having the IETF attendees available.

Do these sessions still make sense? Would we offer the IETF virtual
meeting infrastructure to groups to use when it is not being used for
IETF meetings?

## Remote Hubs

In recent years there has been an effort to establish "remote hubs" 
where groups of IETF members get together and participate remotely from
that physical location.  Would that continue as an option?

Could the virtual meeting perhaps involve connecting together a series
of remote hubs? (And if so, does this then again create a better
experience for people who can go to a hub than for those who cannot?)

# User Journey / Experience

What is the experience of an "IETF attendee" in a virtual meeting?
How does he or she experience the event? 

How could attendees be most effective in getting work done in a virtual
setting?

## Registration / sign-up

What is the registration experience like? How do they initially 
"sign in" as an attendee?

## Side meetings

It is quite common for groups to decide during an IETF meeting to go 
off and have a side meeting. 

- How can this capability be reproduced in a virtual environment? 
- Could the system allow people to create ad hoc meetings in some fashion?

## Hallway conversations

The casual hallway conversations are a key component of IETF physical 
meetings. How can some version of this capacity be made available?

## Unstructured time

How do you incorporate some concept of "unstructured" time where people 
can meet and connect?

## Participating in multiple sessions

It is currently possible for remote participants to join into multiple 
working group sessions at the same time. Users simply connect using 
multiple browser windows, multiple chat rooms or multiple computers. 
How does this impact users' experience?

## Serendipity - discovering other users

Part of a physical meeting involves discovering other people with common
interests or backgrounds. How do you help people find others?

## Voting / Hums

What is the best way to have votes or hums in a virtual meeting? Most current audio conference systems would not make an actual audio hum
possible.  Votes in a chat could be possible but the lag time associated
with remote connections would need to be taken into account.  

Some kind of system where votes take place over a period of time may need
to be developed or used.  This, though, does then introduce a delay into
the meeting while there is a wait for the vote.

## Microphone lines

How do "mic lines" work in a completely virtual meeting? Would this in fact
be a benefit as all attendees would be in the same queue?

## Disruptive Behavior

How do we deal with disruptive behavior in a virtual meeting? It can and 
does happen in meetings - and could potentially happen more easily in a
virtual evironment where people cannot be physically stopped from going to 
a mic or could be removed from a room.

What is the process to exclude someone who is being disruptive? Do we need
moderators to be able to step in and mute or disable someone's connection?
Who makes the decision that someone's behavior is disruptive?

## Mentoring

How would the "mentor" program work in a virtual meeting? The same as with
a physical meeting?

## Inclusivity

How do you bring new people into sessions? How do people learn about side meetings? About hallway conversations?

## T-Shirts

Many attendees value the T-shirts that are usually provided for each IETF.
Without a physical meeting it could be challenging and costly to distribute
T-shirts to attendees.

T-shirts are currently funded by the Host of the physical IETF meeting. If
there is no Host, or if the Host chooses not to fund a T-shirt, there may 
be no T-shirt. 

With a virtual meeting it may be that if there is a Host (see "Sponsorships"
below), the Host would have the same option as the physical meeting - to 
provide a T-shirt or not. The Host could then decide how they would 
distribute the T-shirt.


#  Technical Considerations

Many technical questions need to be discussed.

## Infrastructure

What is the infrastructure used to host a completely virtual meeting?
Are current systems (ex. Meetecho, Jabber chat rooms, audio streams)
sufficient? Would new infrastructure need to be established?

What kind of bandwidth would need to be available for the servers 
hosting the system?

How would we handle connecting large numbers of people at the same time?

## Capabilities

Do virtual attendees have video connections? voice? chat? What kind of
bandwidth would need to be available on the client end?

## Authentication

Today anyone can connect to the remote participation aspects of an IETF
meeting. No authentication is required to join a jabber chat room, listen
to an audio stream or connect to a Meetecho session. Would that need to
change? Would "registration" give you a login to whatever system was
used for the meeting?  Would you not be able to participate without those
login credentials?

## Audio

How do we address issues of lag, stutter, echo and other artifacts of 
current audio conferencing systems? 

Is there a "minimum voice quality" level that is acceptable? (George 
Michaelson has suggested the telco QDU concept is something to consider.)

## Network Operation Center (NOC)

Where does the NOC "exist" for a completly virtual meeting? What is its role?

# Administrative

## Centralized Resources

What is the impact of a virtual meeting on centralized resources such as
support staff? What is the full role of the Secretariat during the meeting?

## Finances

The financial model of a completely virtual meeting needs to be understood.
What would be the financial costs associated with a meeting?

### Initial Investment

Would there need to be an initial investment in infrastructure for the
first completely virtual meeting? Would there then be lower costs for 
the next virtual meeting?

### Registration Fees

Would we charge the same amount to attendees as a regular meeting?

Lou Berger sent the following suggestions to the list related to
registration fees:

1. Remote audio feed and jabber participation should continue to be unpaid and unregistered as now
2. Access to session audio and video recordings should continue to be published as now, without fee or registration
3. Remote video/audio -  registration should be per individual participant (i.e., anyone that speaks/presents) perhaps having hubs include some number of participants.
4. Non-registered/anonymous video (meetecho) listeners should be
allowed, but their mic/text input should be disabled.

### Sponsorships

How do sponsorships work with a completely virtual meeting? Would 
sponsorships be required at the same level as the physical meetings?

If a virtual meeting is sponsored, how is the sponsor given the visibility
that is currently given with a physical meeting? For instance, with the
signage, T-shirts, plenary slides, etc.

In particular, is there a sponsor designated as the "Host" of the IETF
meeting? The Host for physical meetings receives benefits including:

- Prominent mention in materials and promotion of the IETF meeting.
- The "host presentation" speaking slot during the plenary.
- The "Thursday Lunch Speaker Series" time for whatever they wish to present.
- Mention on the T-shirt for the event (if the Host chooses to fund the creation of a T-shirt).

Would we have a "Host" for a virtual meeting?

### Long-term impact

If we were successful in holding a completely virtual meeting, would 
companies no longer be willing to send attendees to physical meetings?
In other words, would the first one start us on a path toward having
all meetings in this fashion? (And are we okay with that?)

## Legal

How do we ensure all attendees, coming in at all times, see and agree to
the Note Well statement?


#  Security Considerations

There are many considerations related to security and privacy that need
to be factored in to a virtual meeting.

## Availability

How do we ensure that an attack such as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) doesn't take out the entire virtual meeting? What about an attack against a particular region?

Similarly, how do we protect against disruption caused by groups on
the Internet who may simply want to disrupt the meeting for the fun of it?
(See the section on "Authentication" earlier.)

## Integrity

How do you know that the person who is logged into whatver system is 
used is in fact who they say they are? In a physical meeting:

- We can see the person and physically identify them.
- Users wear name badges that were issued at registration time.
- There are typically other people who may know many individuals.

How are these physical considerations replicated in a virtual meeting?

## Privacy

What level of privacy protection would be needed for conversations? for
user information? Much of the IETF's work is all done on public email 
lists and archived remote sessions. What level of privacy is needed?

#  IANA Considerations

Are there any IANA considerations associated with a virtual meeting?

# Next Steps

With this initial document published, the intent now is to go back and
start to fill in the sections with possible ideas about how the questions
might be answered.

## Learning from others

Suggestions were made to investigate what lessons can be learned from 
work by other organizations on virtual meetings. Initial suggestions 
included:

- The Internet Society has now hosted two (2015 and 2016) global "InterCommunity" events bringing together ISOC members from around the world. The 2016 event, in particular, was designed to be a virtual event.
- The conference industry has been exploring virtual and/or "hybrid" meetings. There may be value here.
- Universities and specifically Internet2 may have some experience.
- George Michaelson stated: "Van Jacobsen did a lot of work on meeting behaviour online in the MBONE days, working on the whiteboard and vat. He has made observations about weighted-sum voting, speaking controls, inheritence of the state of the meeting."

## Trial?

How would it be possible to do a "trial run" of a virtual meeting?
